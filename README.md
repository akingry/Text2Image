# Text2Image
Application which encrypts Unicode text UTF8 using a Vigen√®re polyalphabetic substitution cipher, converts the encrypted text to binary, then to 24 bit colors, then to a square png image of 10x10 pixel colored rectangles. The resulting image can be converted back to UTF8 text with this application and the proper keyword.
